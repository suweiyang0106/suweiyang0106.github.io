I am a master computer science student at the University of Utah. From Aug. 2023 to Apr. 2024, I work with prof Shandian Zhe as a graduate researcher. It's challenging to step into a new field. I like to solve problems, learn new things, work, and share knowledge with people.  
Before, I was an SSD firmware engineer in Taiwan and was responsible for firmware development and verification. I received my BS and first MS degrees from National Taiwan University of Science and Technology. During my first MS period, I went to RWTH University as an exchange student, which motivated me to study for a second MS degree.

About my research
======
I am bringing signal-processing concepts to deep learning field.  
The goal is to figure out Green function in physics field,  a.k.a kernel function in machine learning field.  
In 2020, a group of people used Fourier transform to filter noise from data in a deep learning framework.  
Afterward, people tried many methods to figure the problem out, like wavelet and Laplace transform...  
Now, I am trying to use fractional fourier transform, which is a near 30 years concept in signal processing field, to figure the problem out.
