I am a master computer science student at the University of Utah. From Aug. 2023 to Apr. 2024, I work with prof Shandian Zhe as a graduate researcher. It's challenging to step into a new field. I like to solve problems, learn new things, work, and share knowledge with people.

Before, I was an SSD firmware engineer in Taiwan and was responsible for firmware development and verification. I received my BS and first MS degrees from National Taiwan University of Science and Technology. During my first MS period, I went to RWTH University as an exchange student, which motivated me to study for a second MS degree.
