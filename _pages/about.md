I am a master student in computer science at the University of Utah. I was working as a graduate research with prof. Shandian Zhe from Aug.2023 to 2024. It's challenging to step into a new field. I like to solve problems, learn new things, work, and share knowledge with people.  

Before that, I was an SSD firmware engineer in Taiwan, responsible for firmware development and validation. I received my BS and first MS degrees from National Taiwan University of Science and Technology. During my first MS period, I went to RWTH University as an exchange student, which motivated me to study for a second MS degree.

About my research
======
I am bringing signal-processing concepts to deep learning field. The goal is to figure out the mapping problem in the physics field.
I applied fractional foruier transform in fourier neural operator, which shows that in more complicated cases, high-frequency and non-stationary datasets, FRFT could be way better than FFT. I proved it in my project research. [Link](https://github.com/suweiyang0106/FRFTNO---Project/blob/main/Result/Project%20presentation.pdf)
